# Mission-to-Mars

## The Module 10 Challenge involved scraping 4 Mars Hemisphere Images and creating our own website to view those images.


## Splinter and BeautifulSoup were used to scrape HTML files. 


## MongoDB was used to store the scraped images.


## Flask was used to create and output the images to a website.






### The following files were created to complete the Challenge and Module 10 exercise:

    *    Mission_to_Mars_Challenge.ipynb -- used to develop and test scaping algorithms.

    *    scraping.py -- used to transform the scraping algorithms into functions.

    *    index.html -- contains the HTML file for the scraped data.

    *    app.py -- applied Flask functions to create the routes and website link for the scraped output.
